This file is included to all cpp files in 7-Zip.
Each folder contains StdAfx.h file that includes "Common.h".
So 7-Zip includes "Common.h" in both modes:
  with precompiled StdAfx.h
and
  without precompiled StdAfx.h

If you use 7-Zip code, you must include "Common.h" before other h files of 7-zip.
If you don't need some things that are used in 7-Zip,
you can change this h file or h files included in this file.
