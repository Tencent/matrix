/*
NewHandler.h and NewHandler.cpp allows to solve problem with compilers that
don't throw exception in operator new().

This file must be included before any code that uses operators new() or delete()
and you must compile and link "NewHandler.cpp", if you use some old MSVC compiler.

The operator new() in some MSVC versions doesn't throw exception std::bad_alloc.
MSVC 6.0 (_MSC_VER == 1200) doesn't throw exception.
The code produced by some another MSVC compilers also can be linked
to library that doesn't throw exception.
We suppose that code compiled with VS2015+ (_MSC_VER >= 1900) throws exception std::bad_alloc.
For older _MSC_VER versions we redefine operator new() and operator delete().
Our version of operator new() throws CNewException() exception on failure.

It's still allowed to use redefined version of operator new() from "NewHandler.cpp"
with any compiler. 7-Zip's code can work with std::bad_alloc and CNewException() exceptions.
But if you use some additional code (outside of 7-Zip's code), you must check
that redefined version of operator new() is not problem for your code.
